On January 15th, 2014, Mayor DiBlasio travelled to PS. 152 in Queens take the steps that some people elected him to do- announce a Vision Zero Plan for NYC, which would utilize 4 agencies to reduce the number of deaths and injuries caused by traffic violence. He chose 152, as it was at that site that 8 year old Noshat Nahian was killed crossing an arterial roadway, Northern Blvd on his way to school. 
Though the ambitious program has created results, mainly with NYPD enforcement, school children are still at a very high risk of being injured or killed in a motor vehicle collision. In fact, collisions are the number one killer of children in NYC.

##A Very Short History 
Last year (2014) marked the lowest number of pedestrian fatalities since the city began keeping records over a hundred years ago. [Source: NY Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/02/nyregion/new-york-pedestrian-deaths-are-lowest-on-record.html?_r=0) 

Yet, more than 132 pedestrians were still killed in traffic. Some of the roughest years for street advocates came in the 1990s when many were being killed yet there hadn't been a response from city agencies and street redesign had yet to take prominance. In 1993, for example, 17 pedestrians were killed on Queens Boulevard alone and it became known nationally as the Boulevard of Death. In 2006, a film titled "Contested Streets" documented the history of the livable streets movement from the 1920s when children and horses ruled our streets to the early part of this century, when traffic, congestion, pollution and a car culture created dangerous conditions for pedestrians. 

Under the Bloomberg Administration in 2007, Janette Sadik-Kahn was appointed DOT commissioner and began implementing bike safety plans, street diets and redesigns, pedestrian plazas and bus rapid transit. Leaning on the models of other major cities, Sadik-Kahn's improvements aided a better flow of traffic and increased the level of safety of most street users.

##Government action
As it stands the Department of Transportation, The Taxi and Limousine Commission, the NYPD and the Department of Health were the main acting partners of the Mayor's plan. The first three have made significant changes and improvements to how they handle reckless driving. The role of the Department of Health is a bit harder to define. They publish the child fatality report and it is our hope that they will work with the wellness department of the Department of Education to formulate a plan for safe walking for children and their caregivers.

##Role of Outreach and Advocacy

 Advocacy groups have been essential in making the push to keep school children safe. This happens at individual schools as well as through concerted efforts of pedestrian safety advocates and NYPD Community Affairs.

##What's ahead
In June, 2014, Mayor DiBlasio again travelled to PS 152 in pursuit of Vision Zero. It was there that he announced the introduction of 9 new traffic laws and acknowledged the State Senates passing of a lower speed limit for NYC. This time, invited guests included those whose voices could not be denied. Family members and loved ones who had lost their own children to traffic violence, and used their pain to be the city's most powerful lobby. 
Clearly as the plan unfolds, the city agencies are seeing that some shortcomings and modifications need to be acknowledged.There needs to be leadership from the Department of Education including school safety plans for each school.

Partnerships between not only city agencies but national and governmental agencies whose missions are to protect children could and should be formed to increase the accessibility to programs and trainings that could help protect children as we wait for Safe Routes to be
