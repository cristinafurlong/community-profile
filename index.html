	     <p class="text-muted byline">By Cristina Furlong and Julia Haslanger | <a href="http://twitter.com/CristinaFurlong">@missmarty70</a> & <a href="http://twitter.com/JuliaHaslanger">@juliajrh</a>| Mar 24, 2015</p>
	    <p>Motor vehicle collision are the leading cause of injury death in children aged 5 to 9, according to the <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/downloads/pdf/ip/ip-nyc-inj-child-fatality-report13.pdf">2013 Child Fatality Report</a> issued by the NYC Department of Health. From 2002 to 2011, 44 children were killed citywide. Eighty percent of those children were pedestrians. </p>
	    <p>And the issue isn't just limited to younger children. For kids between 10 and 14, the number killed in car collisions was actually higher: 57 children, and 68% of those were pedestrians.</p>
	    <p>More recently, 30 children aged 4 to 17 have been killed in traffic violence in New York City since 2012, according to data compiled by <a href="http://www.streetsblog.org">Streetsblog</a>, a transportation advocacy news source in New York. </p>

<p>On February 17, 2015, the city announced the <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/ped-safety-action-plan-queens.pdf">Vision Zero Pedestrian Safety Action Plan for Queens</a> with the intention of reducing traffic fatalities through a joint effort of the NYPD, NYC Department of Education, the NYC Department of Health, and the Taxi & Limousine Commission. </p>
	    <p>The plan itself reflects the broad scale of what is hoped to be accomplished through street redesigns, enforcement, and outreach. </p>
	    <p>Yet, the exclusion of the Department of Education as one of the partner agencies, and a lack of specific actions by the NYPD outside of enforcement, leave over one million school children without targeted attention.</p>
<p>There are more than 460,000 children living in Queens. Around 350,000 children are enrolled in school, both public (84%) and private (16%). 
Studies by the Department of Transportation have identified over 32 schools that have implemented “Safe Routes to Schools” modifications, though capital projects may still be in the works.</P>
	    <p>Measures specifically focused on school children could influence their own risk behavior as well as the deadly routes they travel to and from school. Without changes in school environment, including parent and caregiver behavior and ramped up safety education for our children, the risk of serious injury and death is still high.</p>
	    <p>December 2012 marked the beginning of a deadly time for children in northern Queens, as the borough was rocked by the deaths of <a href="http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20121230/jackson-heights/family-seeks-justice-for-11-year-old-killed-by-dump-truck-hit-and-runl">Miguel Torres</a>, <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/queens-driver-killed-boy-3-charged-dwi-article-1.1483728">Jahair Figueroa</a>, <a href="http://gothamist.com/2013/03/12/van_driver_who_killed_teen_on_queen.php">Drudak Tenzin</a>, and <a href="http://www.streetsblog.org/2014/11/07/new-york-state-dmv-dismisses-tickets-to-driver-who-killed-toddler-allie-liao/">Allison Liao</a>, and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/21/nyregion/boy-8-fatally-struck-by-tractor-trailer-in-queens.html?_r=0">Noshat Nahian</a> among other through the end of 2013. <a href="http://www.citylab.com/commute/2013/12/growing-plea-new-york-pedestrian-deaths-cannot-be-tolerated/7954/">Citylab takes a look at Northern Blvd & Queens.</a></p>

<p>Data on injuries is even more difficult to find, and often excludes  the severity actually suffered. For example, in Maspeth, where an estimated 4,000 students go to and from just 3 schools (IS 73, PS 58 and Maspeth High School)<a href="http://theforumnewsgroup.com/2013/09/19/after-tragic-accident-calls-for-change-in-maspeth"  >a driver who drove onto the sidewalk injuring 5 kids</a>. Marina Abadir, 14, suffered multiple spine fractures, and Ashley Kahn, 14, underwent surgery to repair two fractured legs and two fractured hips. Michael Gomez, 13, died three days later from an asthma attack, but the city medical examiner is still investigating whether or not the death was related to the crash, so it is unclear whether his death was included in the fatality data.	
<p>To date this year, according to the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nycvzv.info&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEWh2R59d8c-t3Ea0cwDckEHXtl6w" ></a>Vision Zero Map,</a> Since 2014, there have been 7 fatalities and 775 injuries city council district 30 alone. There are over 20,000 school children and an overall population of 169,190.

<p>Queens Priority School Locations</p>
<p>One effort by the Department of Transportation has been to identify “priority” schools. Each priority school “receives an individualized planning study which determines both short-term and long-term measures to improve safety,” according to DOT.</p>

<h1>--Advocacy--</h1> 
<p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/Rl1Aqb6.jpg" width="600" /></a> </p>
<p>On January 26th, 2014, groups from across the city rallied with elected officials in Ridgewood, Queens. Though Ella was 23 when she was killed by an MTA bus the year earlier, this vigil marked the beginning of an organized, empowered and relentless advocacy push that would result in the founding of Families for Safe Streets and the passing of 9 pieces of legislation, a reduction in the speed limit city-wide and stiffer penalties for certain traffic crimes. When Ella was killed, there were no advocacy groups in force, so it was a year later that her mom reached out to <a href="http://makequeenssafer.org/home/news/">Make Queens Safer</a>, <a href="http://www.rightofway.org">Right of Way</a>,
<a href="http://www.makebrooklynsafer.org">Make Brooklyn Safer</a>. The vigil was held in her honor, but also revealed a massive poster with the names of over 250 New Yorkers killed in traffic violence.</p>

<p>The presence of elected officials,set a benchmark for what they were committed to and how they have succeeded or failed in the years since then.(an extended version of this piece should track the electeds present that day)</p>
<a href="http://www.transalt.org/getinvolved/neighborhood/queens">Transportation Alternatives Queens Volunteer Committee</a>has worked for safe streets, and redesigns from 21st St, Queensbridge to
<h1> NYPD</h1> 
<p>Speeding within ¼ mile of schools was studied in 2013, with <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/2013-03-school-speeding.pdf">with the highest rates documented, over 75 %of cars speeding.</a></p>
<p>To date, the Vision Zero plan for New York City utilizes NYPD data to target enforcement areas for critical safety improvements based on collisions and poor street design. The addition of speed cameras, which operate in schools zones during school hours only,have been effective in reducing speeds around schools, but <a href"http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/2014-10-speed-camera-faq.pdf">there are only currently 140 active cameras</a> for over 1,400 schools citywide. 
<p>There is a dire commitment on the NYPD’s part to improve the working conditions and overall number of school crossing guards on the streets dedicated to providing safe crossing for our children.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/fswziYZ.jpg" width="600" /></a> </p>
<p>This map shows 48 priority corridors in Queens. Until street redesign takes place our school children need crossing guards to protect them. According to information provided by the Crossing guard union, Local 372 the number of guards has  declined from 2009 to present.</p>
<img src="http://imgur.com/dKSDeyA.png" alt=”Graph of crossing guards” width="600px">
<p>At a March city council hearing on public safety, Council Members  Vanessa Gibson (D16, Bronx), Rory Lanceman (D24, Queens), and Corey Johnson (D3, Manhattan) all questioned Commissioner Bratton on why vacancies exist. </p>
<ul><h4>Some of the answers might include:</h4></ul>
<li>Low pay ($9.33 to start, $13.37 after three years)</li>
<li>Maximum of 20 hours per work week</li>
<li>The dangers and rigor of working at an intersection in traffic</li>
<li>Difficulty of finding the job listing/recruitment only at the local precinct.</li>	/></a>

<p>The NYPD is also in charge of school safety officers and special traffic agents. At times these other officers are tasked with crossing guard duties, but there is no agency standard on when those officers must step in. In cases of injury or death at a crossing location, traffic agents, with the authority to write tickets are detailed to a scene, but only periodically and for a brief time. (example, crossing guard calls in sick)</p>

Additionally, NYPD should ensure that crossing guards are given the proper safety materials, such as signs, reflective gear. </p>

<h1>Department of Education</h1> 
<p>Serving over 350,000 school kids, in 7 distinct school districts, the Department of Education should take on a priority role in keeping kids safe. Though each school is required to have a school safety plan, they are hardly addressed during the school year. 
Below, two offices are mentioned that should be revamped to consider transportation safety. The Office of Safety and Youth Development as well as the Borough Safety Directors. The plan was updated as of January 2nd, 2013 but does not mention pedestrian safety issues.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>School Safety Personnel Procedures and Assignments - This section includes visitor control procedures, security scanning (where
applicable), and protocols for responding to specific disaster or emergency conditions such as fire, sheltering-in, bomb threat, suspicious
packages, hazmat, shooting, and kidnapping. </p>
<p>Chancellor’s Regulation A-414 requires that the following individuals are required to serve on a school’s Safety Committee: The
principal, the UFT Chapter leader, the PT/PTA president (or designee), the school’s Level III School Safety Agent (or designee), the
custodial engineer, the dietician (or designee), the NYPD commanding officer (or designee) of the local precinct, and a student
representative. </p>
<p>Central Office of Safety and Youth Development (OSYD) staff, the Borough Safety Directors (BSDs) assigned to each of the five Boroughs
and representatives from District 75 and District 79 address safety and security issues in our schools each day, providing information,
guidance and support. Safety Administrators make site visits to schools; serve as a resource for principals; work with school safety teams;
provide professional development and training to school personnel; and work with parents on issues relating to student safety. The Office of
Safety and Youth Development also conducts comprehensive safety and security assessments of schools on a continuing basis throughout
the year to assist schools in implementing best practices that establish and maintain a safe and secure school environment, which is the
foundation upon which effective teaching and learning take place.
In addition to its focus on day-to-day safety and security in school buildings and other Department of Education facilities across the city,
the Office of Safety and Youth Development provides professional development to build the capacity of teachers and other school
personnel to implement prevention and intervention programs that engage students in taking responsibility for and improving their own
behavior. Professional development focuses on implementation of comprehensive conflict resolution programs, including peer mediation;
programs which reduce and eliminate bullying and other forms of harassment; and instruction and programming that promote respect for
multicultural diversity.
All students deserve the opportunity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Department of Education has the above mentioned requirement to serve the students of NYC and their parents and caregivers. The priority action that should take place is to have those individual school safety plans include specific actions related to school pick-up and drop off of students. As it stands, cars and parents themselves are putting kids at risk with erratic, impatient driving, parking in crosswalks, or double parking in a manner that has school busses dropping off children in the street. Those driving children to school are known to disregard crossing guards. It should not be allowed in a borough that has schools with populations of 400-3,000 students or more to allow such chaos to exist and be considered acceptable. The responsibility, as noted above, lies with the Office of Safety and Youth Development as well as the Borough Safety Directors. A mandate from schools Chancellor Carmen Farina should provide them the specific responsibility to make this mandatory. </p>
<p>Resources from the Department of Transportation, need to be allocated to schools at a higher rate than they currently are. School principals need to take a leadership position in maintaining safety and good judgement of the parents and caregivers bringing children to school or picking them up. </p>

<h1>Department of Transportation</h1> 
<p>The Department of Transportation has held most of the brunt of establishing Vision Zero in the city. Their efforts on school safety extend beyond the street redesign and detailed traffic studies on the Vision Zero Safety Plan to specific maps for many of the schools in New York City. </p> <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/pedestrians/saferoutes.shtml">School Safety Maps for Schools with Enrollment of 250 or more.</a>

<p>Providing children a safe and healthy environment in which to grow and thrive should be a priority for everyone. Though many measures have been taken and some success has been made, when children are denied their chance to grow up, they leave behind not only their parents, but siblings, friends and classmates who will always remember them. Preston’s P.S.173 in Fresh Meadows still has many issues with driver disregard of the school zone.</p>
