	    <p>Motor vehicle collision are the leading cause of injury death in children aged 5 to 9, according to the 2013 Child fatality report, issued by the NYC Department of Health. From 2002 to 2011, 44 children were killed citywide. Eighty percent of those children were pedestrians. </p>
	    <p>And the issue isnâ€™t just limited to younger children. For kids between 10 and 14, the number killed in car collisions was actually higher: 57 children, and 68% of those were pedestrians.</p>
	    <p>More recently, 30 children aged 4 to 17 have been killed in traffic violence in New York City since 2012, according to data compiled by Streetsblog, a transportation advocacy news source in New York. </p>
	    <p>On February 17, 2015, the city announced the Vision Zero Pedestrian Safety Action Plan for Queens with the intention of reducing traffic fatalities through a joint effort of the NYPD, NYC Department of Education, the NYC Department of Health, and the Taxi & Limousine Commission. </p>
	    <p>The plan itself reflects the broad scale of what is hoped to be accomplished through street redesigns, enforcement, and outreach. </p>
	    <p>Yet, the exclusion of the Department of Education as one of the partner agencies, and a lack of specific actions by the NYPD outside of enforcement, leave over one million school children without targeted attention.</p>
	    <p>Measures specifically focused on school children could influence their own risk behavior as well as the deadly routes they travel to and from school. Without changes in school environment, including parent and caregiver behavior and ramped up safety education for our children, the risk of serious injury and death is still high.</p>
	    <p>December 2012 marked the beginning of a deadly time for children in northern Queens, as the borough was rocked by the deaths of Miguel Torres, Jahair Figueroa, Drudak Tenzin, and Allison Liao, and Noshat Nahian among others through the end of 2013. Citylab takes a look at Northern Blvd & Queens.</p>
	    
 <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/#helper-classes-floats">Quickfloats</a> are handy for pullquotes. You can let them find their own size or use <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid">the grid</a> to set their width.</p>
	    <p>Bootstrap does a lot of fancy footwork to customize layouts on tiny, small, medium and large screens. For now, I suggest that you stick to the <code>col-md-</code> classes. They're the most universal. Our goal here is to tell good stories, not master the finer points of CSS layout, with or without Bootstrap.</p>
	    <p>We didn't talk much about <code>p</code>aragraphs, <code>blockquote</code>s or <code>a</code>nchors, but you'll need them if you don't want your content to run together in a great heap. You can wrap paragaphs in <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags manually, but if you want some help with the basic pieces, I'm a huge fan of <a href="http://mouapp.com/">Mou</a>. You can compose in Markdown, a heavily simplified syntax, and then copy the resulting HTML into a Bootstrap template. Markdown is a very basic language -- you can't do a lot with it, so you can focus on the basics. </p>
